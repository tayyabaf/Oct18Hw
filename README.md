# Design Patterns
SINGLETON
>Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance and provides global access point to this instance
>
> Can only be instanitated once.
> 
> Make the default constructor private and a static creation method

BUILDER
>Lets you construct complex objects step by step.
> 
> Allows you to use different types and representations of an object using the same representation code
> 
> Suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders


PROTOTYPE
>Lets you copy existing objects without making your own code dependant on their classes
> 
> Delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned
> 
> Declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning
> >This interface usually lets u clone an object w/out coupling ur code to the class of an object
> 
> >Usually, such an interface has one clone method


FACTORY
>Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
